## Introduction
This project was crafted to provide an in-depth understanding of each data science methodology. Each methodology is paired with a unique dataset and follows a detailed approach from data acquisition to deployment. 

## Datasets
Three distinct datasets from Kaggle and PapersWithCode are used. Links and brief descriptions are provided below:
1. **Dataset for CRISP-DM**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
2. **Dataset for KDD**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality)
3. **Dataset for SEMMA**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)

## Methodologies
### CRISP-DM
Follows the stages: Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. The detailed process can be found in the respective subdirectory.

### KDD
A tailored approach aligned with the KDD process. Refer to the KDD subdirectory for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### SEMMA
Incorporates the stages: Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess. The SEMMA subdirectory provides a comprehensive breakdown.

## Medium Articles
For each methodology, a detailed article has been crafted providing insights, challenges, and learnings. Links to the articles:
